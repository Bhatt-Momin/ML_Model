## README

This script trains and saves a machine learning pipeline for housing price prediction using the  housing dataset.  
It performs stratified train–test splitting, preprocessing (imputation, scaling, one-hot encoding), and trains a Random Forest regressor.  
If a trained model already exists, it loads the model and pipeline to run inference on new input data and saves predictions to ⁠ output.csv ⁠.
